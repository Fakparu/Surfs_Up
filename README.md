# Surfs_Up
Advanced Data Storage &amp; Retrieval: SQLite, SQLAlchemy, &amp; Flask
1.	Overview of the statistical analysis:
The purpose of the analysis is to get the temperature statistics for the month of June and December, that will help determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round. To get the temperature data, there going to be two queries, one for the month of June and the other for the month of December. Ran the queries,  and the data stored in list, then to a dataframe. From the dataframe the summary statistics.

2.	Results:
o	In June, count =1700, mean = 79.9, min = 64.0 and max = 85.0. June temperature statistics are listed in the table below.

o	The standard deviation for the month of June is 3.25 and December is 3.75. The difference in standard deviation between June and December is .5

3.	Summary:
o	In summary, we got the information, temperature statistics needed to guide open a surf and ice cream shop. However, there are some other weather attributes that can further help the decision such as precipitation, additional queries can help get more data to help the decision.
